# This script automatically fixes your grammarly errors.
![alt text](https://github.com/isneuu/autofix-grammarly-errors/blob/main/gramm.gif "Preview")



### Use case: Large document with 100+ errors
 
### How to use:
1. Go to Grammarly Web app
2. Go to Editor Settings, turn on "Auto-jump to the next suggestion"
3. I made it primarily for the "Correctness" tab in Grammarly. It also works for others.


Paste the code in index.js

 
> Caution: Please keep the tab "active" else it will throw an error.
 
If you can do better, please do! They may change class names or do something different in the future.
